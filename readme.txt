Adds the featured image attached to posts to the beginning of the post content and excerpt in RSS feeds.

== Description ==

This plugin does one thing, and that thing is to add your posts' featured image to the RSS feed. It specifies the 'large' image size.

### Open Graph Meta Tags are also Necessary

Many modern feed readers do not show the images added by this plugin. Feedly, for example, will not show images added by this plugin. Feed readers crawl article pages to find the image attached to posts in the open graph meta tag. Many SEO plugins add open graph tags for featured images. I like the (https://wordpress.org/plugins/opengraph/)[Open Graph] plugin, too.



== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins folder, or use the Plugins > Add New section of your dashboard to search for "Add featured image to RSS feed"
1. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
